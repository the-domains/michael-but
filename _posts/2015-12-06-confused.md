We love a good[movie supercut video][0], and this year's best one comes from Sleepy Skunk, who's cut together the best moments from 2015's films.

These are tricky to do: you need to get the right balance of music, the right transitions and cuts of the films, and most importantly, you need to capture what is great about cinema: the action, the heartfelt moments and the humor.
